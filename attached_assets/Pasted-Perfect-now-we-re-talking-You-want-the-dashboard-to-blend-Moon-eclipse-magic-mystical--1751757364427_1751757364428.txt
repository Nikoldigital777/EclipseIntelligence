* **Manifestation energy** (uplifting, rewarding, feels like your leads and results are coming to life)
* **Authentic REMAX blue and red** (not just corporate, but powerful and dynamic)

Let’s upgrade your UI/UX to reflect **2025-level cosmic branding**—no pink, but with REMAX red as a bold accent. I’ll describe each page and component, referencing specific hex codes and explaining the magic “vibe” throughout. This is **detailed and ready for a designer, developer, or AI agent**.
