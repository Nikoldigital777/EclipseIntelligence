I need to get inbound agent data on my app which api do I use? and how to get data from calls via api like retell has call duration, sentiment etc

Searched inbound agent data API get agent information

Searched get call data API call duration sentiment transcript
For inbound agent data, use the Get Agent API (GET /get-agent/{agent_id}) to retrieve agent details.

For call data (duration, sentiment, etc.), use the Get Call API (GET /v2/get-call/{call_id}) which provides:

Call duration (duration_ms)
User sentiment (call_analysis.user_sentiment)
Call transcript
Recording URLs
Latency metrics
Call cost breakdown
You can also use List Calls API (POST /v2/list-calls) to retrieve multiple calls at once. # List Calls
